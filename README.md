Odin Project - Rebuild Google Homepage

This project is to rebuild the Google homepage using Chrome Dev Tools and a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS.

Basically got it going pretty good but left out the icons in the search bar, I messed up by styling the text input instead of putting everything in a div and styling that.
